# stock-search
A React app that can search stock info with given APIs


Using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), build a form using
React controlled inputs. The form needs to have a search input and search button that
searches for stocks using https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#symbolsearch. To
do so will require an API key https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key.

Acceptance Criteria:
● Based on the user's input, the user gets a list of stock symbols and company
names in a dropdown below the input field while typing in the search field (i.e.
AutoComplete)

● User can click any of the items in list to get a detailed view of the selected stock

● User can click ‘search’ button to get a detailed view of the stock based on their
input

● Search input is always present on the page

● The detailed view can hold as much or as little data as you would like to provide
using the available API

● Form handles errors and shows descriptive error messages to the user

● Compiles CSS from SCSS
